When the code starts, the sentence "Enter item name:" will be displayed on the screen. 
The user will be able to enter the letters of a name and press enter. 
The name of the item that was typed in by the user will be stored and a new line of text will appear on the screen "Enter quantity:".
The user will then have to type in a whole integer number as the quantity of the item that they had previously entered, this number will also be stored.
"Enter cost:" will then be displayed on the screen for the user to input an amount as the cost, decimals will also work for this input. Again, this number will be stored.
Lastly, the screen will display "Total cost for " (the name of the item stored in the system that the user had previously entered) ":$" (the calculation result of the quantity input in the second line of displayed text multiplied by the cost, which was the third line of text that allowed user input)
Then the program ends.
